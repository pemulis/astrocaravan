# Astrocaravan!

Find interesting projects and hacker events in your area! We're building this app to surface cool hackery things that are currently spread out across hundreds of disparate mailing lists, and make it easier for people to collaborate. You can start messing around with our pre-launch app [here](http://astrocaravan.herokuapp.com).

Looks like filepicker.io is being fiddly though and isn't serving images anymore. This project isn't actively maintainted, so I probably won't be going into the demo to fix that.
